# capstone_computer_networking_animation_module

1. Install React

   First need to install node.js from nodejs.org

   Then verify installation:

   ```shell
   $ node -v
   ```

   This will print version installed

   

2. Open VScode (any IDE you want), direct to the directory where you pulled this repo

   ```shell
   $ # this install dependencies needed for our project
   $ npm install
   $ # run the project
   $ npm run dev
   ```

   The output could look like this:

   ```shell
   YOUR_PATH_TO_REPO> npm run dev
   
   > ece496-capstone@0.0.0 dev
   > vite
   
   
     VITE v4.4.9  ready in 811 ms
   
     ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
     ➜  Network: use --host to expose
     ➜  press h to show help
   ```

   Copy the address http://localhost:5173/ to your browser for preview. 



Notes: 

Vite is a web development build tool, supports css,html and javascript, also has development server/localhost.

To create a new project: `npm create vite@latest`

I'm using typescript (TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.)
