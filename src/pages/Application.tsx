          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The application layer sits at Layer 7, the top of the Open Systems
            Interconnection (OSI) communications model. It ensures an
            application can effectively communicate with other applications on
            different computer systems and networks. Application layer has the
            following function:
            <ul>
              <li>
                ensures that the receiving device is identified, reachable and
                ready to accept data;
              </li>
              <li>
                makes sure necessary communication interfaces exist, such as
                whether there is an Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface in the sender's
                computer;
              </li>
              <li>
                ensures agreement at both ends on error recovery procedures,
                data integrity and privacy;
              </li>
              <li>
                determines protocol and data syntax rules at the application
                level; and presents the data on the receiving end to the user
                application.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Layers and TCP/IP model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The overall communications process between two or more machines
              connected across one or more networks is very complex
            </li>
            <li>
              Layering partitions related communications functions into groups
              that are manageable
            </li>
            <li>Each layer operates according to protocols.</li>
            <li>
              TCP/IP is the de-facto industry standard that allows the
              heterogeneous networks to function in a seamless manner.

          <h2>Application architecture considerations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In creating a network app. one has to write programs that:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Run on (different) end systems.</li>
              <li>Communicate over (different) networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Need to have an architectural plan prior to developing any apps.
            </li>
            <p>Consider two possible structure of applications:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>client-server architecture.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Web</li>
                <li>FTP</li>
                <li>Email</li>
              </ul>
              <li>peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>BitTorrent</li>
                <li>Skype</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Client-server architecture</h2>

            <li>Is always running (stays on).</li>
            <li>
              Has a permanent and fixed IP address that is available to clients.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Peers (Hosts) can pair and communicate with each other directly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Peers request service from other peers and in return provide
              service to others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Peers are intermittently connected and may alter their IP
              addresses.
            </li>
            <li>No need for a continuously running server.</li>
          </ul>
          <img src={p2p_png} alt="p2p" className="centered-image" />

          <h2>Communication between process</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When developing an app. need to understand how the receiving end
              recognizes which app. to access.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For instance, server may be running varieties of apps. or
                processes of the same app.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              In fact, an OS process from source communicates with another
              process at the destination.

          <h2>Sockets</h2>

            <li>
              Form the interface between the Application layer and the Transport
              Layer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Are employed by processes on sending/receiving hosts to exchange
              messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processes rely on the Transport layer to ensure the delivery of
              the message to the proper sockets on both ends.
